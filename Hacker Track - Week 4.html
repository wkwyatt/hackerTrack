Hacker Track - Week 4

<script>

//a) Write a function that would return an array of all the odd numbers between 1 to 50. (ex. [1,3,5, .... , 47,49]). Hint: Use 'push' method.

	function oddNumbers() {
   		//Place your code here 
   		return arr; 
	}


//b) Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that squares each value in the array. When the program is done x should have values that have been squared (e.g. [1, 25, 100, 4]). You're not to use any of the pre-built function in Javascript. You could for example square the value by saying x[i] = x[i] * x[i];.

	function squareVal(arr) {
   		//Place your code here 
   		return sqarr; 
	}


//Once finished, email a saved .html file with your answers to hello@digitalcrafts.com with "Hacker Week 4 - First Last Name" in the subject line.
